In my opinion, books are valuable experiences that are summarized by previous people. </div><div>In another words, books actually have no essential difference from personal experiences because they are all experiences. </div><div>Nonetheless, the difference is that books contain other people’s experiences, not yours. </div><div>As we all known that without putting into practice, knowledge is almost useless. </div><div>Besides, you never know whether other people’s experiences are suitable for your situation. </div><div>Therefore, only personal experiences are your most loyal partner. </div><div><br/></div><div>Another important reason is that experiences can bring people exact feelings which books cannot provide. </div><div>For example, you are keen to know more about Tibet and then you have two options. </div><div>Option one is to read a bunch of books related to Tibet. </div><div>And option two is taking a tour in Tibet for several months. </div><div>I strongly believe the option two will leave you much deeper impression, which helps us better understand the meaning of life, such as happiness, sadness and anger. </div><div>And knowing the meaning of life can lead us to uncountable possibilities.</div><div><br/></div><div>Moreover, as human beings, courage is the ultimate power to push us move forward when we face overwhelming challenges. </div><div>Suppose you want to challenge yourself to finish a goal that you have failed once, and after long time hard working, you make it. </div><div>How is your feeling? </div><div>I assume you feel confident and your heart is filled with courage. </div><div>More important, for the next challenge, you will be brave enough to overcome it as well. </div><div>This is the point I want to mention that experiences can give us courage, which is like the beacon light for ships in the dark ocean.</div><div><br/></div><div>In the end, I firmly believe that experiences are more important than books due to its practicability, feelings and life meanings. </div><div>And I encourage everyone to try varies experience when you feel life is dull. </div><div>You will feel life is more colorful than ever if you feel it by heart.</div><div><br/></div></body></html>
