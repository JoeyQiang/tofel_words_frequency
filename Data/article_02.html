(393)</title></head><body><div>If someone ask me that should a factory be built in your community, my answer will be definitely no. </div><div>Not only my subject hunch tells me it is not a smart idea, but also my object logic persuades me to oppose the suggestion. </div><div>I will further illustrate my reasons below.</div><div><br/></div><div>First of all, a factory will produce pollution to the environment. </div><div>Needless to say that there is almost no factories produce zero harmful substance to the environment. </div><div>Even though a factory might increase the local economic situation, the history has told us that abandoning environment to compensate for economic development is a silly idea. </div><div>It is not a progressive and continuing development plan. </div><div>After all, the final goal of a city is to provide a better living place for people. </div><div>When environmental destruction happens, it may be too late to spend multiple times of money to recover the environment.</div><div><br/></div><div>Another important reason is the risk of over-population. </div><div>As is known to all that a factory can attract labors. </div><div>When an increasing number of workers go to a city, especially if the city has no plan for that, it might be a disaster for local people. </div><div>For example, there might not be enough parking lots. </div><div>At rush-hours, traffic jam always happens.</div><div>And the rising house price and the rising food price will also come. </div><div>Even worse, maybe the newborn children don’t have enough schools to study, which is the last thing we want to see.</div><div><br/></div><div>Moreover, the factory might change people’s lifestyle. </div><div>Suppose you used to live in a quiet and cosy town, but suddenly a noisy factory comes into your life. </div><div>And both your classmates and relatives work for the factory due to the high salary.</div><div>Therefore, your parents also want you to work for the factory but you haven’t got ready yet.</div><div>You will have a mental pressure and cognitive dissonance. </div><div>You are expected to do something that you don’t want to do, which I call lifestyle change. </div><div>After all, it is always not easy to say goodbye to yesterday.</div><div><br/></div><div>Generally speaking, I disagree to build a factory in my community. </div><div>Admittedly, there are several advantages to build a factory in local, such as improving salary and increasing city tax revenues. </div><div>But after comparing disadvantages with advantages, a factory is not the thing that I want to see to appear around my neighborhood. </div></body></html>
